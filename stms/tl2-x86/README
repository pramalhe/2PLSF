Introduction
------------

TL2-x86 is a port of SUN's TL2 [1] that works on x86. For information on TL2 and
how it works, please refer to RELEASENOTES. TL2-x86 was created by Chi Cao Minh
(caominh@stanford.edu).


Building STAMP with TL2-x86
---------------------------

1) In tl2-x86, build libtl2 using the command "make -f Makefile.real".

2) In STAMP/common/Defines.common.mk, edit the variable "STM" to point to tl2-x86.

3) Compile a STAMP benchmark using the command "make -f Makefile.stm".


Platforms
---------

TL2-x86 has been tested on Ubuntu 6, Ubuntu 7, Fedora Core 5, Fedora Core 6,
CentOS 4, and CentOS 5, on both 32-bit i386 and 64-bit x86_64 architectures.
